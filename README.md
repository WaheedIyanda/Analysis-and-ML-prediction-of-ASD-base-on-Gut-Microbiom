Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a profound neurodevelopmental condition characterized by atypical behavioral patterns, including difficulties in social interaction, repetitive behaviors, and narrow interests. The prevalence of ASD has surged, affecting 1 in 59 children in the United States, and is notably prominent in China as well. Notably, there is a growing body of evidence linking gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms like gas, diarrhea, and constipation to ASD core symptoms in affected children. Recent research suggests a connection between alterations in gut microbiota and changes in gastrointestinal health, immune function, and behavior through the gut-microbiome-brain axis. Consequently, researchers are exploring the microbial composition of the gut in ASD children to unravel its potential role in influencing and reflecting the symptoms of ASD.
